                <h3 class="subhead" style="font-size: 4rem;">HALO STARS</h3>
                <h1 class="display-6">As I entered the password, one of the walls groaned and suddenly fell down on the other side with a bang. I closed my eyes as the dust surrounded me. I coughed and opened my eyes slowly to see a huge tomb. The first thing that I noticed was a coffin located in the centre of the tomb. It was kept about 100 metres away from down a couple of steps. There was a huge dome at the top and the circular room felt as empty and sad as the lone coffin in the centre. There were small openings at the top of the tomb which allowed sunlight to enter the tomb. 


                    I walked across to the coffin and I observed the engravings on the walls on the tomb. I could notice that half of the tomb was inscribed in some strange old language and the other half had strange keyboard characters, resembling... ASCII characters? Why did I know this? I had no idea what ASCII was, but just remembered the name ‘ASCII’ somehow. 
                    
                    
                    As I came closer to the coffin, I could see some engravings in english marked on them. The biggest engraving in the centre was, “HERE LIES AUXIN” 
                    
                    
                    Auxin? Where have I heard this before? I could faintly remember some bad memories associated with the word Auxin. 
                    
                    Puzzled, I continued to search for clues in the tomb. 
                    
                    
                    I walked up to the right half of the tomb where there were strange inscriptions along with a few archaic drawings. In the drawings I could see a few men gathered together working on separate work benches and working on…. computers?! There was also a painting in which there was a family sitting around a dining table focusing on a mobile in their hands. The ancient paintings strangely yet quite accurately portrayed the modern scenario. I continued to analyse the old inscriptions and drawings until I arrived at the other half with ASCII characters. 
                    
                    
                    These encryptions in contrast to the old inscriptions did not seem to have any apparent meaning behind them. They were random drawings of some animals and other creatures. After taking a round of the entire tomb, I came back to the coffin. Worn out after taking a round and unable to comprehend the symbols I was perplexed and sat on the coffin. 
                    
                    
                    I had not rested since I woke up in that strange small room. I looked back at the room from where I had come to see a comfortable bed waiting for me. I jumped back to the ground and headed towards the bed. Exhausted from the excursions, I laid in bed thinking about the symbols and before I knew it, I dozed off.
                    
                    Waking up, the first thing I felt was hunger. I looked around the room to find some food and water but I failed in my attempt. After managing to ignore my appetite, I took the pains to explore further and made my way out of the room. I saw that the sky had gotten darker, but it wasn't dusk. I tried to make sense of what was written on the coffin and what was drawn on the wall, but I could not seem to make head or tail of it.
                    
                    
                    Hungry and confused, I strolled around the place and then finally sat against the wall.The sun had set by now and the tomb was eerily lighted by the bright stars that dotted the horizons. There in the beautiful night sky, I saw a bear-shaped constellation which I recognised as the famous Ursa-Major. I sighed, looking at the beautiful pattern that adorned the sky. 
                    
                    
                    Suddenly, an idea struck my mind! I looked behind me to see the figure of a bear drawn on the wall. This flustered me and I started to connect the dots. Istarted looking for further patterns and focused on the ASCII side, which had different animals, and saw each animal match with a constellation which could be seen exactly where the animal was engraved. Similarly, for the old drawings, I could see the shape of the constellations Orion and Andromeda match with the shape of hunter and a chained woman. 
                    
                    
                    I closely observed all the drawings, and to my surprise I found two animals not matching any constellations. I figured out what constellation was missing from the entire puzzle and went to the coffin to see the name of the animal representing the constellation that was made of two other animals. I tried to press that engraving on the coffin, and suddenly, there was a huge groan and the entire room shook. I lost my balance and fell on the floor, and when I got up I saw... 
                    
                    
                    The dusty gold coffin had opened and a blue light shone from it...
